  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      I’m currently in the <strong>second year of my Master’s program</strong>, working as a
      <strong>student research assistant</strong> at <strong>Saarland University</strong> under
      <a href="https://www.mhahn.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof.&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Hahn</a>
      and <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg/members/verademberg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof.&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Vera&nbsp;Demberg</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I've worked on several projects covering different aspects of large language models, from the expressivity of transformer and state-space models to mechanistic interpretability in in-context learning. 
      Recently, we finished a project aimed at understanding <em>which theoretical limitations of transformer architecture persist in pre-trained LLMs (PLMs)</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I’ve also begun my thesis with <a href="https://yihongl1u.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yihong&nbsp;Liu</a> at the <a href="https://cisnlp.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schütze&nbsp;Lab</a> at LMU Munich, trying 
      to figure out <em>why better cross-lingual alignment fails for better cross-lingual transfer</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      After graduation, <strong>I plan to pursue a PhD</strong> and join my interests in multilingual NLP, mechanistic interpretability, and efficient and robust NLP to make multilingual LLMs more interpretable and robust. 
      I am looking forward to turn the Left-Behinds and the Scraping-Bys<sup id="fnref-acl"><a href="#fn-acl" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a></sup>
      at the very least into Hopeful and Rising Stars of the field.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I perform stand-up comedy, make mixed drinks (like espresso martinis and blue lagoon) for my friends, and hit 1.5X my bodyweight squats at the gym. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Feel free to hit me up to talk about work or hobbies, I am always happy to chat :)
